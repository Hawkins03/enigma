# enigma
A enigma machine I built using python origionally, and am now rebuilding in C.

NOTE. This is still in progress, and currently doesn't work. 

Todo:
- change rotor into a struct (char * ) followed by char [2]. (2nd is turnovers)

=======
To see a working version I built three years ago (that is a total mess (hense the rewriting)) go to master
