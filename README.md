# enigma
A enigma machine I built using python. 
Requires python version 3.7+. Optimal usage is using terminal as I was able to make a tui using the curses module
Alternately use new.py

NOTE. This is still in progress, to see the working version (that has atrotious code I wish I didn't write (it was four years ago) check out the other branch

Todo:
- change rotor into a struct (char * ) followed by char [2]. (2nd is turnovers)
