# enigma
A enigma machine I built using python. 
Requires python version 3+. Optimal usage is using terminal as I was able to make a tui using the curses module
Alternately use new.py


Todo:
- Make code pretty
  - Show output somewhere
  - create a drawline function
- Make ctrl+q ezit tui
- Make exception handling
