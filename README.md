# enigma
A enigma machine I built using python. 
Requires python version 3+. Optimal usage is using terminal as I was able to make a tui using the curses module
Alternately use new.py


Todo:
- Make code pretty
  - Show output somewhere
  - create a drawline function
- Make ctrl+q exit tui
- Make exception handling

- Make it read terminal args so that --nointerface or -n makes it run without tui and -h or --help prints a help message
- Update rotors in the encrypt function
- save updated rotors to settings function
- make settings window
- make british version
